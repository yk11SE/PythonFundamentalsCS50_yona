# Indoor Voice

WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.

Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.

In a file called `indoor.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

Hints
- Recall that input returns a str, per <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input>.
- Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods>.

## Before You Begin
Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

		$
Next execute

		mkdir indoor
to make a folder called indoor in your codespace.

Then execute

		cd indoor
to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as indoor/ $. You can now execute

		code indoor.py
to make a file called indoor.py where you’ll write your program.

# How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually. At the `indoor/ $` prompt in your terminal: :

1. Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `HELLO` and press Enter. Your program should output `hello`.
2. Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `THIS IS CS50` and press Enter. Your program should output `this is cs50`.
3. Run your program with `python indoor.py`. Type `50` and press Enter. Your program should output `50`.

# Commit your progran to GITHUB
At the `indoor/ $` prompt in your terminal:

		git commit -m “[descriptive message]“
Commit all changes in the REPO

		git push 
Push all changes to the REPO
